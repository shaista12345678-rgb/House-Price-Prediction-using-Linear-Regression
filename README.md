# House-Price-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression

 1. Introduction
 This project analyzes a dataset of books to understand prices, ratings, authors, and
 publishing trends. I used Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to clean the data,
 explore it, and create visualizations.
 2. Data Loading and Cleaning
 I loaded book data.csv, checked the data with head(), info(), and describe(), and looked
 for missing values. I also cleaned columns like book price if needed.
 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Calculatedaverage and median rating and price
  Foundtopauthorsbynumberofbooks
  Foundauthorswiththehighest average ratings
  Createdcharts: top authors, top-rated authors, price vs rating, yearly publication
 trend, and distribution plots
 4. Results
  Someauthorsappearmoreoftenthan others
  Afewauthorshavehigher average ratings
  Priceandrating have a weak relationship
  Numberofbookspublishedchangesyear to year
 5. Conclusion
 The dataset shows clear patterns in authors, ratings, and yearly publishing. Price
 alone does not explain rating differences.
 6. Recommendations
 Clean price values better, add more features (like genre), use correlation tests, and
 try predictive models
